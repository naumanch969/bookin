Life is too short to play small with your talent.
An addiction to distraction is the death of your creativity.
If you come to know what went into it, you wouldn't call it genius.
All changes are hard at first, messy at the middle and gorgeous at the end.
Dream big, do small, start now.
The smallest of completion is better than greatest of intention.
Your limitation is nothing but your mentality.
Living the same weak for few thousand of times and calling it life.
Victims love entertainment. Victors adore education.
One who sweats more in training bleads less in the battlefield. - Tolstoy
Only people who are capable of loving strongly can suffer great sorrow. - Tolstoy
You have to keep your heart breaking until it opens. - Rumi
